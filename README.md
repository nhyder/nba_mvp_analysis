Research the existence of "voter fatigue" in NBA voting using R.

This project is an ad hoc research project meant to improve my skills in R. The main aspects include:
* Web scraping using the `rvest` package
* Building an analysis dataset
  * Merging on team stands by year
  * Correcting some data quality issues
  * Building features for model
* Running logistic and regression models to determine how well I can predict MVP and determining the affect that previous year voting has on current year likelihood to win MVP
